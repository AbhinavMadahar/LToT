0,"Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? If Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and she eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins, then she is left with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market.
Since she sells each fresh duck egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

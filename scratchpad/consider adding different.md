consider adding different language models during candidate generation which generate candidates which we expect to be lower utility and evaluating whether they are added to the mainline beam or added to to the lateral beam. the insight here is that LToT can process a large number of low-quality candidates, so it might be possible to extract use out of candidates which are on average lower quality

- smaller models,
- higher temperature, etc
